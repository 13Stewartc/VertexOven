# Issues blocking first release on Blender Market

## P1
* [x] Take new screenshots of settings dialog (MUST BE COMPLETE BEFORE RELEASE)
* [ ] Create a slide for performance, and how vertex colors can be faster and look better than baked AO
* [ ] Add emphasis about how vertex color AO is much faster when dealing with lots of objects than AO
* [ ] Download some models and bake AO on them for the gallery (At least one or two should be done by release.)

## After release
* [ ] Backport documentation from Blender Market to GitHub (can be done after release)
* [ ] Take screenshots demonstrating pitfalls of vertex-based AO
