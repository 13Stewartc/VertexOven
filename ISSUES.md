# Issues blocking first release on Blender Market

## P1
* Take new screenshots of settings dialog (MUST BE COMPLETE BEFORE RELEASE)
* Download some models and bake AO on them for the gallery (At least one or two should be done by release.)
* Create a slide for performance, and how vertex colors can be faster and look better than baked AO
* Add emphasis about how vertex color AO is much faster when dealing with lots of objects than AO

## After release
* Backport documentation from Blender Market to GitHub (can be done after release)
* Take screenshots demonstrating pitfalls of AO
